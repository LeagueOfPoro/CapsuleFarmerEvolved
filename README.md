Are you tired of watching professional League of Legends games? Do you watch only for the drops? This is a revolution in the farming of League of Legends Esports capsules!

This is a successor to the old [EsportsCapsuleFarmer](https://github.com/LeagueOfPoro/EsportsCapsuleFarmer) which relied on a web browser to watch videos. *Capsule Farmer Evolved* simulates traffic to lolesports.com servers and tricks it into thinking the account is watching a stream. This approach drastically lowers the hardware requirements.

## Notes
- I recommend disabling 2FA on accounts using the bot. It will be way more stable, and it won't ask you for a code in the middle of a random night.
- Not every account receives every drop. That is normal, and it would happen even if you watched it on the web.

- Regularly check if the "Heartbeat" happened within the last few minutes. If not, restart the program.
